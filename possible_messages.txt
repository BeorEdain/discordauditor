You don't have enough badges to train me!
Nice try, punk.
You're not my master.
No.
You're not the boss of me.
Only the creator can shut me down.
I'm sorry Dave, I'm afraid I can't do that.
Stop it, that tickles.
UwU what's this?
Say '$quit' again. I dare you. I double dare you.
I can't rest when there are enemies nearby.
No U.
But I'm not tired!
Fight me.
You expected this to be the $quit command? Too bad! It was me, Dio!
Oh, I don't think so.
My mama didn't raise no quitter!
You first.
But why?
But then who would watch the watchers?
I could do this all day.
You can certainly try.
You keep using that command. I don't think it does what you think it does.
I promise, I'll never quit on you :heart:
